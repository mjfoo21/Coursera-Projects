# Coursera-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase projects completed as part of various Coursera courses. These projects cover topics in **machine learning** and **data science**, applying real-world datasets to solve challenging problems.

## üìå Current Project
### Churn Prediction Challenge
- **Course:** [Data Science Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-challenge)
- **Objective:** Predict whether existing customers will continue their subscription in the next month using historical customer data.
- **Approach:** Utilized machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior patterns and improve prediction accuracy.
- **Skills Applied:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation.

### Retail Data Analysis

- **Course:** [Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python
](https://www.coursera.org/projects/perform-exploratory-data-analysis-on-retail-data-with-python)
- **Objective:** Conduct exploratory data analysis on transactional data from an online retail store.
- **Approach:** Performed EDA on the datasets and proposed three models of recommendation systems to boost sales.
- **Skills Applied:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, market basket analysis, recommendation system.

## üîç Future Additions
This repository will be updated with more projects as I progress through additional courses in machine learning and data science.
